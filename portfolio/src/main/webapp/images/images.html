			<h3>Great Minds in Stem</h3>
			<p>My first time attending Great Minds in Stem. Great experience meeting engineers with like-minded
				goals. I was also a Northrop Grumman Scholar due to my efforts of being an exceptional
				engineering
				student. </p>

			<h3>HackGT</h3>
			<p>This was my first ever hackathon and it was in Georgia Tech. The reason I look dead in the
				picture is

			<h3>Paint and Hang</h3>
			<p>I made this painting as part of a 3 hour art class. Doing this made me glad I went out of my comfort
				zone to something an engineer does not "normally" do. This has motivated me to look for other
				diverse experiences.</p>

			<h3>Destroy the Hate</h3>
			<p>This project was with the Resident Area Government. The idea was that people would write words that
				are full of hate and at the end of week the wall will be destroyed. It symbolized the destruction of
				hate.</p>
