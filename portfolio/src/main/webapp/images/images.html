		<h3>Great Minds in Stem</h3>
		<p>My first time attending Great Minds in Stem. Great experience meeting engineers with like-minded
		   goals. I was also a Northrop Grumman Scholar due to my efforts of being an exceptional engineering student. </p>
      </div>

	    <h3>HackGT</h3>
		<p>This was my first ever hackathon and it was in Georgia Tech. The reason I look dead in the picture is
		   because it was 3 in the morning day 2. My trip consisted of mostly learning what others in the 
           CS community are doing.</p>

		<h3>Going to UF</h3>
		<p>This was my first photo as a University of Florida Gator. It was portrayed in my Highschool's main
		   office along with other students going to UF.</p>

		<h3>Floor Mural</h3>
		<p>I helped in painting a Mural in my local resident community. The project was very time consuming, but
		   enjoyable with the team I was in. The idea was to draw a world and then make a mark in the place you were born. 
           Symbolizing that we all have diverse experiences but can still be together. </p>

		<h3>Paint and Hang</h3>
		<p>I made this painting as part of a 3 hour art class. I am glad I went out of my comfort
		   zone to something an engineer does not "normally" do. This has motivated me to look for other
		   difference experiences.</p>

        <img src="pic7.jpg" alt="Mountains" style="width:100%">
		<h3>Destroy the Hate</h3>
		<p>This project was with the Resident Area Government. The idea was that people would write words that
		   are full of hate and at the end of week the wall will be destroyed. It symbolized the destruction of
		   hate.</p>

		  <h3>Giving Back</h3>
		  <p>This project was about giving back during the time of Thanksgiving. With donations from generous
		     people, we bought food for families that were in need. We packaged the food to have equal amounts
			 and later distrubuted to the families.</p>

		<h3>We are Santa</h3>
		<p>Similar to the Giving Back project, we recieved donations for toys and dispersed them through
		   families in need. Kids were given present and told it came from Santa.</p>

		<h3>Panama Canal</h3>
		<p>I took this picture during my internship at the Panama Canal. I was in the nergy division of the
		   canal and my job had to deal with the fuel provided to two thermoelectric power plants. In this
		   photo, the maintanece division way doing maintenece on the Miraflores Locks. </p>
